This model was trained using YOLOv8 for weapon detection over 16 epochs with a 640×640 input size, using the best.pt checkpoint for inference. During this project, the main challenge was the limited size and diversity of the training dataset, which caused the model to misclassify certain weapon types — for example, predicting knives and handguns as automatic rifles. The dataset lacked variation in lighting, background, angles, and distances, which limited the model’s ability to generalize to real-world cases. For better performance, I recommend building a larger, balanced dataset with more samples per class, captured in diverse conditions, and supported by high-quality annotations. Incorporating data augmentation and sourcing from multiple datasets can further improve robustness. While the model performed well on training and validation data, its accuracy on real-world images highlights the need for richer, more representative data. Ethical use should remain a priority, ensuring the system serves lawful and protective purposes only.
